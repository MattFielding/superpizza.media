Hello! I see you could possibly be one of those lazy internet browsers. Funny huh? Not probably... Anyways, let me introduce myself, I'm Alex. I'm your average comic creator. (probably not though...)  Why am I not average? Good question my dear reader.

The main character of the comics is........ a pizza. I like pizza as much as I like my family. I also forgot to say I'm currently 10. When my next B-day comes I will change it to say I'm older.

If you don't like pizza GET OFF THIS WEBSITE RIGHT NOW BEFORE I... Just kidding, feel free to stick around and chill in your pyjamas and have your daily dose of internet. If you've never heard of the main characters they should be on the first page for you and your parents to check out.

At the school I go to, I'd say I fit in with the 'funny' type of person in my class but most of the others think I'm the commonly known as ANNOYING. YOU HEAR ME HARRISON? I'M NOT THAT STUPID. anyways feel free once again to stop reading this nearly endless abyss of words and check out the rest of superpizza.media. I mean it is at least a good website right? Goodbye!
